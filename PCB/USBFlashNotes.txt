PA11, PA12 are USB- and USB+ respectively

PA11 and PA12 are currently occupied by LED_RED and LED_BLUE, which should be moved to 
PC15 and PC13 (check if PC13 and PC15 are GPIO)

ESD Protection with USBLC6-2SC6
-ESD Protection chip should be close to the USB connector

USB- and USB+ traces should be of equal length
- Differential matching required, based on distance apart, trace width should be calculated
- https://jlcpcb.com/pcb-impedance-calculator (USB impedance should be 90 ohms)

USB Flash and Debug does not seem particularly useful compared to the increased time and effort associated with its implementation --- Talk to Kyle about this
